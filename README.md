# Useful_ShellScripts
In this repository, shell scripts of various purposes are stored.
1)GetFilesFromFolders.sh
This shell script recursively zips, moves, or copys all files from the current directory and all directories the current directory contains.
(This script might not work in certain cases where there are too many files as in UNIX-like systems, there is a limit in the argument length)
